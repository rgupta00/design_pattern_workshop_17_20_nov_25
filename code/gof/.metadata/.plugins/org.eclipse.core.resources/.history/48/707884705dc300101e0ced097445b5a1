/*
 * 
The Chain of Responsibility (CoR) design pattern
----------------------------------------------
	 allows a request to pass through a 
	chain of handlers where each handler decides
	 either to process the request or pass it to the next handler.
 
	Customer Support System
	-----------------------------
	When you raise a support ticket:
		1. First handled by a bot.
		2. If unresolved, passed to agent.
		3. Further escalated to manager if needed.
	This is exactly how CoR works.
